# NanoLux Documentation
This projects implements the [NanoGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) using [Lux](https://lux.csail.mit.edu)
I wrote this implementation as a training exercise to get familiar with ML tooling in Julia.
There are few write-ups on how to work practically with ML in Julia out there. I think it would be nice to
have more and hope you find this implementation and documentation useful.
